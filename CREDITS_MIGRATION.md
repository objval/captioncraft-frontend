# Credits Real-time Migration

## Overview
Successfully migrated credit balance fetching from API-first with hardcoded fallback (91 credits) to direct Supabase real-time connections that show actual user credit balances.

## Issues Found & Fixed

### 🐛 **Hardcoded Credits Problem**
- **Navbar**: Displayed "91 credits" regardless of actual balance
- **Dashboard**: Credit card showed "91 credits" instead of real balance  
- **Credits Page**: Showed "91 credits" in available credits display
- **Profile Page**: Credits display was using fallback value
- **Upload Modal**: Used hardcoded value for credit validation

### 🔧 **Root Cause**
The `useCreditBalance` hook was using `api.getCredits()` which always fell back to returning `{ credits: 91 }` when the external API was unavailable.

## Files Changed

### 1. `hooks/use-credit-balance.ts` (UPDATED)
- **Before**: Used API call with hardcoded fallback of 91 credits
- **After**: Direct Supabase query with real-time subscription
- **Features Added**:
  - Real-time credit updates via Supabase subscriptions
  - Proper error handling with meaningful error states
  - Manual refresh capability
  - Loading and error states

### 2. `lib/credits.ts` (NEW)
- **Purpose**: Dedicated credit operations library
- **Functions**:
  - `getUserCredits()`: Get current user's credit balance
  - `updateUserCredits(userId, credits)`: Admin function to update credits
  - `addUserCredits(userId, amount)`: Add credits using atomic DB function
  - `deductUserCredits(amount)`: Deduct credits for video processing
  - `subscribeToUserCredits(userId, onUpdate)`: Real-time subscription setup

### 3. `lib/api.ts` (UPDATED)
- **Before**: `getCredits()` returned hardcoded `{ credits: 91 }`
- **After**: Falls back to Supabase query for real credit balance
- **Improvement**: No more hardcoded values, uses actual database data

## Real-time Functionality

### ⚡ **Live Updates**
- Credits update automatically across all components when:
  - User purchases credit packs
  - Admin manually adjusts credits
  - Credits are deducted for video processing
  - Payment processing completes

### 🔄 **Subscription Management**
- Each component gets real-time updates via PostgreSQL changes
- Automatic subscription cleanup on component unmount
- Channel-based updates prevent memory leaks

## Components Affected (Auto-Fixed)

All these components now show real credit balances automatically:

1. **Navbar** (`components/layout/navbar.tsx`)
   - Credit balance display in top bar
   - Mobile-friendly credit indicator

2. **Dashboard** (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
   - Main credit balance card
   - Credit statistics

3. **Credits Page** (`app/dashboard/credits/page.tsx`)
   - Available credits display
   - Credit pack purchasing interface

4. **Profile Page** (`app/dashboard/profile/page.tsx`)
   - User profile credit information

5. **Upload Modal** (`components/video/upload-modal.tsx`)
   - Credit validation before upload
   - Insufficient credits warnings

## Database Integration

### 📊 **Profiles Table**
- **credits** column: `integer` type storing current balance
- Real-time subscriptions on `UPDATE` events
- Atomic operations via `add_credits()` database function

### 🔒 **Security Features**
- User authentication required for all credit operations
- User-specific queries prevent data leakage
- Database-level constraints ensure data integrity

## Testing Results

### ✅ **Verified Functionality**
- Database query confirmed real user data: `test@example.com` has 2783 credits
- No more hardcoded "91 credits" anywhere in the application
- Real-time updates work across all components
- Error handling gracefully falls back to 0 credits

### 📈 **Performance Benefits**
- Direct Supabase queries eliminate API overhead
- Real-time subscriptions provide instant updates
- Reduced load on external API endpoints
- Better user experience with live credit tracking

## Usage Examples

```typescript
// Using the improved hook
const { credits, loading, error, refreshCredits } = useCreditBalance(user?.id)

// Using the credits library
import { getUserCredits, addUserCredits, deductUserCredits } from '@/lib/credits'

// Get current credits
const balance = await getUserCredits()

// Add credits (admin/payment processing)
await addUserCredits(userId, 100)

// Deduct credits (video processing)
await deductUserCredits(1)
```

## Impact Summary

🎯 **User Experience**: Users now see their actual credit balances in real-time across all components
🔧 **Developer Experience**: Centralized credit management with proper error handling
⚡ **Performance**: Direct database queries with real-time updates
🛡️ **Reliability**: No dependency on external API availability for credit information
