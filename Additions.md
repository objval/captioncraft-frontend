## Feature Enhancement Requests for CaptionCraft Platform

### 1. AI-Based B-Roll Generation
- Integrate an AI module to generate B-roll video clips based on:
    - Uploaded scripts, video, or audio files.
    - User-provided prompts or ideas.
- Evaluate APIs/platforms such as Kling, Veo3, Runway, etc. Compare pricing and quality before selection.

### 2. Thumbnail Generation
- Implement a thumbnail creation feature (similar to Pikzels) that supports Hebrew.
- Allow users to generate cover images for their clips before final export.

### 3. User Profiling & Memory
- On first use, prompt users to describe their video topics (e.g., mortgage consultant, restaurant owner).
- Store user profiles and preferences to personalize future content creation, similar to ChatGPTâ€™s conversational memory.

### 4. Social Media Integration
- Enable users to link their Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube accounts.
- Allow direct video uploads to these platforms from CaptionCraft.
- Provide an option to schedule posts for later publication.

### 5. AI Content Creation for Social Posts
- Use AI to generate social media post content and hashtags based on:
    - Uploaded scripts, video, or audio.
    - User-provided ideas or prompts.
- Support viral-style B-roll video creation.

### 6. Logical Workflow
- First-time users are onboarded with a profiling step.
- For each content creation session:
    1. User uploads video/audio or provides an idea.
    2. System analyzes input and generates:
         - Subtitles
         - AI B-roll scenes
         - Social media post content and hashtags
         - Thumbnail images
    3. User can upload content to social networks or schedule posts.

### 7. Hebrew Language Support
- Ensure all AI modules (content creation, thumbnail generation, etc.) support Hebrew.
